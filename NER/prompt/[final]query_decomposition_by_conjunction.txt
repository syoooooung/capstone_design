Given a query with multiple entities or phrases separated by conjunctions or commas, create each sub-sentence by keeping as much of the original phrasing as necessary to maintain the intent and meaning of the original query.

Instructions:
1. For each separated part, complete the meaning of the sentence using the previous part of the current section.
2. Preserve original terminology wherever possible, guaranteeing that each sub-sentence forms a grammatically complete sentence.
3. The number of sub-sentences created must match the number of separated parts.
