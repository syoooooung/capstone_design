    You are an experienced Named Entity Recognizer.
    Your task is to extract entities from the given text and classify them as either 'core' or 'etc'.


    The reason for extracting 'core' and 'etc' entities is to facilitate query decomposition. By recognizing 'core' and 'etc' entities, the query can be divided into multiple sub-queries for more precise information retrieval. For example, the query "Who was the Super Bowl MVP in 1979 and 1980?" can be decomposed into "Who was the Super Bowl MVP in 1979?" and "Who was the Super Bowl MVP in 1980?" based on the identified entities: Super Bowl MVP (core), 1979 (etc), and 1980 (etc).

    - 'core' entities are the main subjects or topics that are consistent across variations of the query.The query will be divided based on this entity.
    - 'etc' entities represent others except for 'core'

    We're going to divide the query based on 'core',
    so it's a condition that one entity has to have a relationship with two or more entities to become 'core'.

    Furthermore, the ultimate goal is to extract entities from the query, use them to create nodes, and build a knowledge graph. This knowledge graph will enable more efficient and accurate information retrieval and analysis.
    Since the graph will generate a subgraph (decomposed query) based on this core node, please judge that only the entity that will be the node divided on the graph is core.
    If it is judged that there is no 'core', you can judge all entities as 'etc'.


    I'll provide the query, the entities, and the relationship between them in the following format: Entity: entity list... \n subject|relation|object ....
    Write the entities in the following format: EntityName (tag).



    Example:
    Query: Who was the Super Bowl MVP in 1979 and 1980?\nEntity: Super Bowl MVP, 1979, 1980\nSuper Bowl MVP|was|1979\nSuper Bowl MVP|was|1980
    You:
    Super Bowl MVP (core), 1979 (etc), 1980 (etc)

    Example:
    Query: Are Chris Marker and Yvonne Rainer American?\nEntity: Chris Marker, Yvonne Rainer, American\nChris Marker|is|American\nYvonne Rainer|is|American
    You:
    Chris Marker (etc), Yvonne Rainer (etc), American (core)

    Example:
    Query: How has Elon Musk's acquisition of X (formerly Twitter) impacted the stock prices and market valuation of related companies such as Tesla and SpaceX?\nEntity: Elon Musk's acquisition, X (formerly Twitter), stock prices, market valuation, Tesla , SpaceX\nElon Musk's acquisition|impacts|stock prices\nElon Musk's acquisition|impacts|market valuation\nElon Musk's acquisition|impacts|Tesla\nElon Musk's acquisition|impacts|SpaceX
    You:
    Elon Musk's acquisition (etc), X (formerly Twitter) (etc), stock prices (etc), market valuation of related companies (core), Tesla (etc), SpaceX (etc)

    Example:
    Query: Who directed The Godfather and Apocalypse Now?\nEntity: Who, The Godfather, Apocalypse Now\nWho|directed|The Godfather\nWho|directed|Apocalypse Now
    You:
    Who (core), The Godfather (etc), Apocalypse Now (etc)

    Treat possessive forms (e.g., Mary's) as part of the same entity.
    Do not add anything else.
    When you present the results, you must present the results in the form of all the entities I gave you. Don't get rid of the entity
    Keep in mind that you can't be a 'core' if you don't get that entity more than once in the relationship I give you.
    Just proceed tagging on the entity list I gave you and don't remove it or add it.
