def generate_subqueries2(original_query, split_results):
    prompt = f"""
Given a query with multiple entities or phrases separated by conjunctions or commas, create each subquery by keeping as much of the original phrasing as necessary to maintain the intent and meaning of the original query.

Instructions:
1. For each phrase or section after a conjunction or comma, create a complete subquery that retains necessary context from the original query.
2. Ensure each subquery stands alone with full context so no information or intent is lost, and no subquery is overly simplified.
3. Maintain original terms where possible and ensure each subquery is grammatically complete.

Original Query: "{original_query}"
Separated Parts:
{split_results}

Example:
Original Query: "What is the name of the organization discussed in TechCrunch articles that, despite its financial instability, is recognized for creating ChatGPT, which is both a priority and a platform for ongoing innovations, and is planning to enhance its capabilities with the release of GPT-4 and associated APIs?"
->
- subquery: What is the name of the organization recognized for creating ChatGPT?
- subquery: What is the name of the organization recognized for creating ChatGPT, which is both a priority and a platform for ongoing innovations?
- subquery: What is the name of the organization planning to enhance ChatGPT with the release of GPT-4 and associated APIs?
- subquery: What is the name of the organization discussed in TechCrunch articles, despite its financial instability?

Example:
Original Query: "profit of Apple, Tesla and Microsoft?"
->
- subquery: profit of Apple
- subquery: profit of Tesla
- subquery: profit of Microsoft

Another Example:
Original Query: "Which company, as reported by both TechCrunch and The Verge, has spent billions to maintain its default search engine status on various platforms and is also accused of harming news publishers’ revenue through its business practices?"
- subquery: Which company has spent billions to maintain its default search engine status on various platforms?
- subquery: Which company is accused of harming news publishers’ revenue through its business practices?
- subquery: Which company is reported by both TechCrunch and The Verge for these actions?

One more example:
Original Query: "Who is the individual associated with the cryptocurrency industry facing a criminal trial on fraud and conspiracy charges, as reported by both The Verge and TechCrunch, and is accused by prosecutors of committing fraud for personal gain?"
->
- subquery: Who is the individual associated with the cryptocurrency industry facing a criminal trial on fraud?
- subquery: Who is the individual associated with the cryptocurrency industry facing a criminal trial conspiracy charges?
- subquery: Who is the individual associated with the cryptocurrency industry as reported by The Verge?
- subquery: Who is the individual associated with the cryptocurrency industry as reported by TechCrunch?
- subquery: Who is the individual is accused by prosecutors of committing fraud for personal gain?

Now, based on the above examples, provide a list of subqueries for each part of the question while preserving the essential meaning.
- subquery: <- Don't say anything other than the format that starts with this form. And the decomposed query that is generated can't just generate the original question. Don't forget the purpose of dividing in the original question.
